# facemask-detection-using-python
COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. 
Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. 
Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. 
This paper presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn. 
The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not.
